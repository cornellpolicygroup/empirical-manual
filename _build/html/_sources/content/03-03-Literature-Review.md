# Literature Review

> *Reviews existing research relevant to the topic, identifying gaps that your study aims to fill. **Discuss only five to six (5-6) key articles.***

**This section should consist of two brief parts:**

The first subsection should discuss articles directly related to your research question. They can be articles on the same topic you’re studying in addition to articles that use the same methodology, dataset, or model as your research.

The second subsection should elaborate on how your research is contributing to the literature. Think: *What am I doing differently?* and *How am I improving on what’s already been done?*
