# Empirical Methodology

> *Details the methods and models used to analyze the data, including any statistical or econometric techniques.*

State your econometric specification (i.e., your regression equation) then explain your variables and parameters of interest. 

Be sure to explain why your specification is the correct specification to approach your question and where your identification method is coming from (e.g., theory, previous empirical work) in addition to detailing any additional tests or procedures you will be running as part of your research design.
