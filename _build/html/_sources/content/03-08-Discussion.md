# Discussion
> *Interprets the results, linking them back to the research questions and literature review. It explores implications, limitations, and potential future research.* 

Below are some further considerations to guide your discussion:

- Only discuss the most interesting and important estimates from your tables.

- Discuss whether your parameter estimates are statistically significant and why or why not. 

- Compare your results to what others have found and discuss how your findings are similar or different to othersâ€™.

- Discuss measurement issues with sincerity and thoroughness.

> **Good guiding questions are:**
> - What are the ambiguities of my results?
> - What are possible alternative interpretations?
> - What are the strongest arguments for one interpretation versus the other?
> - What directions for future work are suggested by the results?
