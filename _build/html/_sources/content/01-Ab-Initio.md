# CPG Empirical Project Ab Initio

## Empirical Research Project Overview

The empirical research project is designed to address a policy question through original, quantitative research on the issue.

An intensive, formalized research opportunity, the project provides analysts with an additional opportunity to engage in policy analysis aside from the policy proposal, video essay, and op-ed.

The project is designed to emulate the research, drafting, and publication processes professional researchers follow in the social sciences.

## Logistics

**Below are general guidelines regarding project logistics and process:**

- There may be as many or as few teams working on different research questions as desired.

- Each research team may comprise **up to four to five (4-5) analysts.**

- Analysts involved in an empirical research team will work on the empirical project *instead of* the policy proposal.

- Each research team will have **one (1) designated lead author** who will lead and direct the research team. Aside from contributing to the research process, the lead author will ensure the team follows the writing timeline and guidelines.

- Each research team will have autonomy and discretion as to how to best direct their research. However, templates and support will be provided by E-Board and the editing team (i.e., EIC and Associate Editors) where needed.

- After internal drafting and editing has been completed, the editing team will provide additional edits.

- Word processing softwares like Microsoft Word or Google Docs may be used during the drafting and editing process. **The final manuscript, however, will be rendered using LaTeX** on Overleaf according to the Springer Nature manuscript template (accessible [here](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/springer-nature-latex-template/myxmhdsbzkyd)).
