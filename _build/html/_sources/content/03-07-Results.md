# Results

> *Presents the findings of the empirical analysis, often with tables, charts, and graphs. This section focuses on the data without interpretation.*

Aside from presenting a thorough review of your results and estimates, **consider the following:**

- Present your results step by step in a way that systematically develops your argument.

- Clarity is king. Make sure it is clear which dependent variable a table is in relation to, which control variables are included, and what specification is being used in addition to specify robust standard errors.

- Use graphs meaningfully. Consider the most illustrative means of visually conveying your results and use them.
