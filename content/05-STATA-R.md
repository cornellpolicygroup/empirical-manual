# STATA & R Training Modules

Courtesy of PREDOC.org and the University of Chicago, free materials on how to use STATA and R, statistical analysis programs often used in the social sciences, can be found [here](https://canvas.uchicago.edu/courses/43117).

There are also many other online and print resources to aid your learning of STATA and R. A user-friendly textbook on how to use R can be found [here](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/intro) while a comprehensive (albeit aesthetically off-putting) site on how to use STATA can be found [here](https://www.princeton.edu/~otorres/Stata/).

For video resources, an easy-to-follow playlist of R tutorials can be found [here](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLKBUk9FL4nBYpUKszG4edyAiM9aeTT1yv&si=mCbSdFNytycrtMr9) while a good start-up playlist of STATA tutorials can be found [here](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLGg_xGebrRg2sSyZUprlyzuKg_gRrrffZ&si=K37Q1m6rpbkLQxZl). [This](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLtKGNX49fOCbrhBGmTlvFoE2xE7zujjjv&si=buwnagxS0US9fAU-) playlist also covers how to use STATA, but in direct relation to econometric methods.
