**This section should be presented in two parts:**

The first subsection simply names and describes the dataset. Present the data type (e.g. panel, cross section), time period, unit of analysis, and limitations (e.g., missing observations).

The second subsection should present relevant descriptive statistics of the data. This includes tables of relevant variable means and standard deviations in addition to graphs of different subgroups (e.g., treatment vs. control groups).
