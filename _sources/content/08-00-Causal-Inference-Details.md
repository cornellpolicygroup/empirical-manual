# Building Blocks: Causal Inference
  
## Overview

This section will provide reference material on different techniques of causal inference you may wish to use in your research designs. Though this module is by no means meant to supplant a formal course in causal inference (e.g., PUBPOL 4101/ECON 3717, INFO 3900), it should be helpful to both the trained and untrained analyst in navigating the econometrics of empirical research.

## Sections

After a brief refresher on statistical inference and linear regression, this section will have pages on:

- Potential Outcomes Framework
- Randomized Experiments (RCTs)
- Selection on Observables (SOO)
- Instrumental Variables (IV)
- Regression Discontinuity (RD)
- Fixed Effects (FE)
- Difference-In-Differences (DD)
- Synthetic Controls (SC)

Content on these main pages or subsequent subpages may be added or revised over time. Please check back frequently for new changes or open an issue to suggest ideas or submit errors!
