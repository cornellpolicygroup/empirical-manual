# Manuscript Format

**Below is the layout your manuscript (paper) should follow.** 

With the exception of the abstract, the word/page counts next to each section are suggested; only the abstract’s 120-word limit is obligatory. 

These limits are to emulate the length guidelines professional journals in the social sciences typically stipulate.
